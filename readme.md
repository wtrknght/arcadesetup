Hi, I'm currently making an arcade machine and this will be used in a cinnamon version of arch. Any version will work but panel will only hide the bottom panel on cinnamon. One of the only current limitations (limited by my knowledge of bash)is that I cannot edit the grub script in bash to make the time to select zero which may be good or bad.
